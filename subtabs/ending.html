        The ending:
        The protag will talk to friend Lila. (Briefly mentioned) If they missed her
        birthday, they'll have an apology and discuss what was happening.

        Either way, they'll have a discussion about how to deal with certain stressors
        at college, and healthier/unhealthy ways to deal with them.

        They will also mention / provide links to resources if needed.
