            GEEZ. I love my roommates. But they will NOT. BE. Quiet. I have another quiz at 8AM tomorrow, and 
            my noise cancelling headphones aren't working. I don't want to upset them though, because they've been stressed this month as well. 
            Can't they just be quiet though???
